# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#What are the 5 moste danceable songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata ORDER BY danceability DESC LIMIT 5;

#What artists appear more than once in the top 50 chart?
SELECT artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name HAVING COUNT(artist_name)>1;

#I created a common table expression to find the artists on the chart with an average popularity of 90 or larger.
WITH popularity_average_cte as (
SELECT s.artist_name,
 AVG(s.popularity) as popularity_average
  FROM Spotifydata s 
  GROUP BY s.artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, popularity_average, 'Top Star' as tag FROM popularity_average_cte WHERE popularity_average>=90;
