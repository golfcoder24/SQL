#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product = "iPhone";


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cust INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb ON cust.order_ID=feb.orderID;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE price=(SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY Product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' GROUP BY Product; 


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(price*Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.customers c LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f ON c.order_id=f.orderID WHERE f.Quantity>2;


#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY Product;
